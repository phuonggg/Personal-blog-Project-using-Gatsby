## My 10 Day Silent Vipassana Meditation

About this time last year, I went to stay in a meditation center in the middle of nowhere in Chiba for 10 days. Ten days of just meditating, no phone, no reading, no writing, no talking, no eye contact, just complete silence.

Chiba meditation center
Always curious mindfulness - friend - quit job - isolated from world, no phone, don’t call, parents thought go nuts

Life during the 10 days
This place - schedule

Silent rules
Give things, silent rules, funny walk- vegan - no dinner, but no tired eventually, just legit sit and slow walk - concept of no literal noise like sounds & also any source of info that trigger thoughts, eg read

Concept of mindfulness in meditation
The idea is to stop all external factors so that you can truly pay attention to your breath, your body which are the signals of your being, your existence; from that you can be fully aware of your being, your existence, and understand how everything else is just external, whether they’re good or bad, they will come and go eventually. And if you have that awareness, it’ll affect your viewpoints about life, humanity, etc. But they all come from observing, being aware of your breath and body.

Meditate, meditate, and… meditate
Difficult: wish book - not talk, eye contact part easy - reading/watching part’s hard (hard to sit and walk and just think about your breath, your body and it’s sensations)

Mediated through my birthday >”<
Stick till the end anyway- birthday, woke up oh birthday cool just gonna meditate from morning to night

Meditation is a consistent habit
The whole thing was quite an experience - Consistent, habit - guilty not consistent but understand the meaning and how to practice technique so can continue anytime

Time to think
OPTIONAL: Actually decided try coding after left when i had some offer of new jobs similar to my last job that i had applied before the course, lots of time to think and i just feel this sense of free, that i might not like it, i might not be good at it, but i feel a sense of free from those fears and just go for it

Silent zone
And realize can totally do fine without anything in modern life for awhile if i ever want to be in the zone again;)

Maybe you can try?;)
Try if you have a chance, it’s not gonna magically change anything, but it’s quite an unique experience itself and it might introduce you to explore further mindfulness and its impacts in your life - still pretty hardcore, don’t think will do again anytime soon, maybe 3 days
